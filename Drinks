Little Vasya loves orange juice very much. That's why any food and drink in his kitchen necessarily contains orange juice. There are n drinks in his fridge, the volume fraction of orange juice in the i-th drink equals pi percent.

One day Vasya decided to make himself an orange cocktail. He took equal proportions of each of the n drinks and mixed them. Then he wondered, how much orange juice the cocktail has.

Find the volume fraction of orange juice in the final drink.

Input
The first input line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of orange-containing drinks in Vasya's fridge. The second line contains n integers pi (0 ≤ pi ≤ 100) — the volume fraction of orange juice in the i-th drink, in percent. The numbers are separated by a space.

Output
Print the volume fraction in percent of orange juice in Vasya's cocktail. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 10  - 4.
